## A Note from the Desk of Cave Johnson, CEO

Alright, you're here. That means you're the best of the best. The cream of the crop. The folks who looked at a perfectly good car that you have to steer with your hands and said, "I can do better." I like that. A lot.

Here at Aperture, we don't follow the road. We invent a new one, pave it with science, and then teach a car how to follow it so you can eat a sandwich. Welcome to the future. Welcome to the Aperture Science Self-Driving Automobile Initiative. We're going to make cars so smart, they'll be able to feel disappointment when you get a parking ticket.

## Our Unbeatable Scientific Approach

My eggheads tell me we've broken this thing down into what they call 'stacks'. Sounds flimsy, but they assure me it's the sturdiest way to throw science at a problem until it gives up.

### Stack One: The 'Don't Hit That' Control Stack

We've already cracked this nut. We've got something called a "Stanley PID Controller" running in a simulation chamber called 'Carla'. I'm told it's a whiz at not driving into walls. The whole thing runs on a newfangled operating system for robots, 'ROS 2'. They call it 'Humble'. I call it 'Genius'. We also have a 'Bicycle Kinematic Model'. That's right. We're so advanced, we're making cars think they're bicycles. It's groundbreaking stuff.

### Stack Two: The 'Where in the Heck Are We?' Estimation Stack

A car that can't hit a wall is one thing. A car that knows where it is? That's the ticket. We're using Kalman Filters, Iterative Closest Point algorithms‚Äîall sorts of fancy words. We're blasting the world with light using 'Lidar' to create 'point clouds'. It's like giving the car a million eyes. And we're pairing that with IMUs to make a motion model. That way, our car isn't just guessing; it's making a highly-educated, Aperture-brand guess.

### Stack Three & Four: Perception & Path Planning

Still in the oven. The science boys are working on it. How hard can it be? Just teach the car the difference between a pedestrian and a cardboard cutout of a communist dictator. My advice? When in doubt, run over the communist. He's not gonna complain.

## A Word On Our So-Called 'Competition'

You might have heard of a little outfit called Black Mesa. Sounds like a snooze-fest, doesn't it? While they're busy playing with crowbars and causing 'resonance cascades'‚Äîwhatever that is‚Äîwe're here doing REAL science. Let them have their fancy-pants government funding. We're funded by grit, ingenuity, and the sale of shower curtains that repel bullets. You tell me which one is building a better tomorrow.

## Mandatory Reading for New Hires

My assistant, Caroline, tells me there are some educational VCR tapes out there that can get you up to speed.

- **[University of Toronto's Self-Driving Car Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars)**: Good stuff. Smart folks up there in Canada.

- **[Stanford's Algorithm Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)**: Algorithms, people! That's the secret sauce!

- **[Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Tapes](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)**: This fella's teaching machines how to think. We're teaching them how to drive. It's a match made in heaven.

## Aperture Science Safety Disclaimer

By cloning this repository, you agree that Aperture Science is not liable for any incidents, accidents, or unforeseen temporal paradoxes that may occur. This includes, but is not limited to: sentient turrets, cars that develop a fear of heights, or portals opening up to alternate dimensions where the mantis-men have won. Good luck.
